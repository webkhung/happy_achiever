  %h1 Feeling Unenergized?

%h2 Quick Fix #1: Move your body

Exercise will make you feel more energized, awake and alert. And getting up and moving around will help you fight off fatigue.

Walk around your office. Go outside and get some fresh air. Do some stretches. Any activity that gets your blood pumping will help lessen fatigue.

%h2 Quick Fix #2: Take a nap

Taking a nap can help you fight off fatigue. The trick is not to nap for too long.

If you nap for more than thirty minutes, your body will go into deep-sleep mode. Then, when you're awakened, and pulled out of deep-sleep mode, you'll be left feeling groggy, and your fatigue will be worse than before.

Instead, limit naps to fifteen or twenty minutes. That will be enough to recharge your flagging battery.

%h2 Quick Fix #3: Take some deep breaths

Taking a few deep breaths is probably the quickest, easiest remedy for fatigue. Deep breathing will relax you and re-energize you at the same time.

A few of these might be all you need to say good-bye to fatigue.

%h2 Quick Fix #4: Put on some music

The right music could re-energize you. Pick something upbeat that makes you want to smile. If it also makes you want to tap your toes and snap your fingers, it's just the music you need to fight fatigue.

%h2 Quick Fix #5: Snack on an energy booster.

There are foods that can help boost your energy when fatigue hits. Try eating a banana, an apple, an orange, or some raisins.

%h2 Quick Fix #6: Splash cold water on your face

Splashing some cold water on your face can help wake you up.

%h2 Quick Fix #7: Caffeine's okay every once in a while

It's okay to use caffeine to give you're the occasional energy boost. But don't rely on it regularly.
